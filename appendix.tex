\chapter{Glossary of data science terms}

\begin{singlespace}
\begin{longtable}{p{0.3\linewidth}p{0.7\linewidth}}
\caption{Data science terms: Interpretation}\\
\hline
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Intelligibility}} & Similar to interpretability, can processes or results be understood by humans. However, not all humans understand equally. So perhaps
intelligibiilty is context-dependent. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Evaluation} \\ \textbf{(of interpretation)}} & An interpretation is an intelligible assertion about the world that may be evaluated in various ways, such as usefulness,
or validation by quantifyable proxy. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Explainability}} & Explaining model behavior, why or how a result is generated. Interpretability is necessary but not sufficient for explainability. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Completeness}} & Accuracy of explanations. A simplified, less-complete explanation may be intelligible and pursuasive, but potentially misleading or
unethical. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Contrastive explanation}} & Explaining a result by contrast with a different case. E.g. Why was my application rejected but this other one accepted? \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Algorithmic Transparency}} & Opposite of opacity and black-boxes, can the system's processes by investigated. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Algorithmic Fairness}} & Are results unbiased? In some domains could violate legal anti-discrimination protections. In research science, could raise COI
concerns. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Accountability}} & Related to transparency, can methods and results be accounted for algorithmically. E.g. waiter, how was this service charge calculated?
And how was the price of the paella determined from the ingredient list, labor costs, and overhead? \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Black-box system}} & Non-transparent, opaque system, not explainable since the specifics of the process for generating a result are inaccessible. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Pursuasive systems}} & Human opinions and decisions can be affected, and systems can be optimized for pursuasiveness, but accuracy may be compromised. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Context-aware systems}} & For HCI issues of Interaction Design and Learnability, context-aware systems connect the application logic to the user and UI
designer.  \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{iML}} & Interpretable ML \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{FATML}} & Fair, accountable and transparent ML \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{XAI}} & Explainable AI, a term favored by US-DARPA. \\

\begin{table}
\caption{Data science terms: Wrangling}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.3\linewidth}p{0.7\linewidth}}
\hline
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Data cleaning}} & Processing of files to fix or remove various kinds of errors and inconsistencies and prepare for analysis.  E.g. numerical values which are
not interpretable as numbers, removal of cases with missing necessary values, values which are obvious errors (e.g. DOB in future).  E.g. converting problematic
character encodings to ASCII or UTF-8. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Dirty data}} & Needs a lot of cleaning, maybe much of the overall effort. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Tidy data}} & Data organized and described well by metadata, such as in tables with well defined columns, and files with standard formats (e.g. CSV). \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Data munging}} & Approximately: Various transformations to process data into clean and tidy files.  Converting among formats, parsing multiple fields from
one delimited string, etc. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Noisy data}} & Data may be clean and tidy but the values may reflect much randomness, such as measurement error.  E.g. resting blood pressure measurements
may vary a lot from the "true" value for a patient. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Data wrangling}} & Approximately: Various processes for cleaning, tidying, and transforming data into forms suitable for computation. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Data formats}} & File types used to contain and communicate data, such as JSON, XML, and CSV, but which can vary greatly within these and other general
families. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Extract, Transform} \\ \textbf{and Load (ETL)}} & Common term describing the wrangling workflow for building a database from a data source. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Feature Extraction}} & Some types of raw data such as image or audio lack well defined features, which must be defined based on domain knowledge. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{ML-Ready Dataset}} & After all the cleaning and other wrangling is done, and the dataset is an acceptable input file for the ML components, it is said to be
ML-ready.  Many ML examples, tutorials and challenges (e.g. Kaggle) deal with ML-ready data only and ignore or minimize the importance of data wrangling. \\

Classification of Diseases. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Taxonomy}} & Hierarchical organization of entities, such as the taxonomy of organisms into plants, animals, etc. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Ontology}} & Refers to both an organization of entities and relations and related knowledge, and the study of such knowledge systems. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Semantic Web} \\ \textbf{Technologies}} & A set of community approaches, formats and methods first inspired by Tim Berners Lee in 2001, and organized through the W3C. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{RDF}} & Resource Description Framework, a foundation of SWT, wherein all knowledge is represented by semantic triples. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Semantic Triples}} & Subject - predicate - object triples, the unit of knowledge in RDF. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Sparql}} & RDF query language. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Knowledge Representation}} & Refers to the methods and formats of encoding and storing human knowledge, such as by RDF semantic triples, but also the basic

indicate the 2nd and 98th percentiles. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Visual Channels}} & Informative characteristics, such as color or shape or size. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Pre-Cognitive Awareness}} & Visualization can facilitate cognition by employing this natural pattern recognition capability.  For example, seeing patches of
color in a heatmap is easier than reading and abstracting from all the numbers. \\

\caption{Data science terms: Miscellaneous}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.3\linewidth}p{0.7\linewidth}}
\hline
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Machine Learning}} & Somewhat imprecise term, but generally a set of computational approaches for perceiving patterns or predicting endpoints from data, and
often big data.  Historically ML is associated with computer science, but shares much with statistics and other fields. \\

hypotheses for further investigation. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Data Mining}} & EDA focused on knowledge discovery \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Confirmatory Data} \\ \textbf{Analysis}} & Involves a pre-defined hypothesis, tested by the analysis.  A randomized controlled trial is an important example. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Randomized Controlled} \\ \textbf{Trial (RCT)}} & In medicine, a designed, prospective study involving patients randomly assigned to test and control groups, and
normally "double blind" procedures whereby neither the patient nor the clinician administering the treatment knows whether the treatment is test or control. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Domain Knowledge}} & Refers to the domain where the final value and impact of the analysis is assessed, such as business, medicine, sports, military. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Retrospective Study}} & Involves existing data, predicting outcomes which must be hidden during training for strong validation. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Prospective Study}} & Involves predicting and validating against future outcomes. \\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Artificial Intelligence}} & Big topic with much history and varying meanings and nuances.  Somewhat inseparable from the study of human cognition, since one
important driver of AI is its resemblance to human cognition and ability to perform tasks previously requiring humans.  Autonomous cars and other robots are fairly
clear examples of AI. \\
