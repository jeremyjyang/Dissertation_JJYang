\begin{tabular}{p{0.3\linewidth}p{0.7\linewidth}}
\hline
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Data cleaning}} & Processing of files to fix or remove various kinds of errors and inconsistencies and prepare for analysis.  E.g. numerical values which are
not interpretable as numbers, removal of cases with missing necessary values, values which are obvious errors (e.g. DOB in future).  E.g. converting problematic
character encodings to ASCII or UTF-8.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Dirty data}} & Needs a lot of cleaning, maybe much of the overall effort.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Tidy data}} & Data organized and described well by metadata, such as in tables with well defined columns, and files with standard formats (e.g. CSV).\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Data munging}} & Approximately: Various transformations to process data into clean and tidy files.  Converting among formats, parsing multiple fields from
one delimited string, etc.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Noisy data}} & Data may be clean and tidy but the values may reflect much randomness, such as measurement error.  E.g. resting blood pressure measurements
may vary a lot from the "true" value for a patient.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Data wrangling}} & Approximately: Various processes for cleaning, tidying, and transforming data into forms suitable for computation.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Data formats}} & File types used to contain and communicate data, such as JSON, XML, and CSV, but which can vary greatly within these and other general
families.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Extract, Transform}\\ \textbf{and Load (ETL)}} & Common term describing the wrangling workflow for building a database from a data source.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Feature Extraction}} & Some types of raw data such as image or audio lack well defined features, which must be defined based on domain knowledge.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{ML-Ready Dataset}} & After all the cleaning and other wrangling is done, and the dataset is an acceptable input file for the ML components, it is said to be
ML-ready.  Many ML examples, tutorials and challenges (e.g. Kaggle) deal with ML-ready data only and ignore or minimize the importance of data wrangling.\\
