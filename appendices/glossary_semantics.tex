\makecell[r]{\textbf{Identifiers}} & Names or numbers used to identify entities.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Entity mapping}} & Associating data fields corresponding to the same entity, but using different systems of identifiers.\\

\makecell[r]{\textbf{URI vs. URL}} & Uniform Resource Identifier are persistent IDs employed in RDF, which may or may not be URLs available on the WWW.\\

\makecell[r]{\textbf{OWL}} & Web Ontology Language, W3C standard for ontology representation.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Knowledge Representation}} & Refers to the methods and formats of encoding and storing human knowledge, such as by RDF semantic triples, but also the basic issue in cognitive science which applies to human and artificial intelligence alike: What is knowledge in relation to cognition?\\
