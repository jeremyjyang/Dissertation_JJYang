\caption{Data science terms: Miscellaneous}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.3\linewidth}p{0.7\linewidth}}
\hline
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Machine Learning}} & Somewhat imprecise term, but generally a set of computational approaches for perceiving patterns or predicting endpoints from data, and
often big data.  Historically ML is associated with computer science, but shares much with statistics and other fields.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Exploratory Data Analysis}\\ \textbf{(EDA)}} & Analysis without specific hypothesis, usually to learn about a dataset, describe, and discover patterns and potential
hypotheses for further investigation.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Data Mining}} & EDA focused on knowledge discovery\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Confirmatory Data}\\ \textbf{Analysis}} & Involves a pre-defined hypothesis, tested by the analysis.  A randomized controlled trial is an important example.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Randomized Controlled}\\ \textbf{Trial (RCT)}} & In medicine, a designed, prospective study involving patients randomly assigned to test and control groups, and
normally "double blind" procedures whereby neither the patient nor the clinician administering the treatment knows whether the treatment is test or control.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Domain Knowledge}} & Refers to the domain where the final value and impact of the analysis is assessed, such as business, medicine, sports, military.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Retrospective Study}} & Involves existing data, predicting outcomes which must be hidden during training for strong validation.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Prospective Study}} & Involves predicting and validating against future outcomes.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Artificial Intelligence}} & Big topic with much history and varying meanings and nuances.  Somewhat inseparable from the study of human cognition, since one
important driver of AI is its resemblance to human cognition and ability to perform tasks previously requiring humans.  Autonomous cars and other robots are fairly
clear examples of AI.\\
\makecell[r]{\textbf{Knowledge Graph}} & Nodes and edges, like any graph, but representing entities and relationships.\\
