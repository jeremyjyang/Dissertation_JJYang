  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bioassay data analysis continues to be an essential,
              routine, yet challenging task in modern drug discovery and
              chemical biology research. The challenge is to infer reliable
              knowledge from big and noisy data. Some aspects of this problem
              are general with solutions informed by existing and emerging data
              science best practices. Some aspects are domain specific, and
              rely on expertise in bioassay methodology and chemical biology.
              Testing compounds for biological activity requires complex and
              innovative methodology, producing results varying widely in
              accuracy, precision, and information content. Hit selection
              criteria involve optimizing such that the overall probability of
              success in a project is maximized, and resource-wasteful ``false
              trails'' are avoided. This ``fail-early'' approach is embraced
              both in pharmaceutical and academic drug discovery, since
              follow-up capacity is resource-limited. Thus, early
              identification of likely promiscuous compounds has practical
              value. RESULTS: Here we describe an algorithm for identifying
              likely promiscuous compounds via associated scaffolds which
              combines general and domain-specific features to assist and
              accelerate drug discovery informatics, called Badapple:
              bioassay-data associative promiscuity pattern learning engine.
              Results are described from an analysis using data from MLP assays
              via the BioAssay Research Database (BARD) http://bard.nih.gov.
              Specific examples are analyzed in the context of medicinal
              chemistry, to illustrate associations with mechanisms of
              promiscuity. Badapple has been developed at UNM, released and
              deployed for public use two ways: (1) BARD plugin, integrated
              into the public BARD REST API and BARD web client; and (2) public
              web app hosted at UNM. CONCLUSIONS: Badapple is a method for
              rapidly identifying likely promiscuous compounds via associated
              scaffolds. Badapple generates a score associated with a
              pragmatic, empirical definition of promiscuity, with the overall
              goal to identify ``false trails'' and streamline workflows.
              Unlike methods reliant on expert curation of chemical
              substructure patterns, Badapple is fully evidence-driven,
              automated, self-improving via integration of additional data, and
              focused on scaffolds. Badapple is robust with respect to noise
              and errors, and skeptical of scanty evidence.",

              important genotype-phenotype associations, however, data quality

              scientists seeking to prioritize targets based on the available
              evidence, these issues go beyond the single study. METHODS: Here,
              we describe rational ranking, filtering and interpretation of
              inferred gene-trait associations and data aggregation across
              studies by leveraging existing curation and harmonization
              efforts. Each gene-trait association is evaluated for confidence,
              with scores derived solely from aggregated statistics, linking a
              protein-coding gene and phenotype. We propose a method for
              assessing confidence in gene-trait associations from evidence
              aggregated across studies, including a bibliometric assessment of
              scientific consensus based on the iCite Relative Citation Ratio,
              and meanRank scores, to aggregate multivariate evidence. RESULTS:
              This method, intended for drug target hypothesis generation,
              scoring and ranking, has been implemented as an analytical
              pipeline, available as open source, with public datasets of

  abstract = "Many bioactivity databases offer information regarding the
              biological activity of small molecules on protein targets.
              Information in these databases is often hard to resolve with
              certainty because of subsetting different data in a variety of
              formats; use of different bioactivity metrics; use of different
              identifiers for chemicals and proteins; and having to access
              different query interfaces, respectively. Given the multitude of
              data sources, interfaces and standards, it is challenging to
              gather relevant facts and make appropriate connections and
              decisions regarding chemical-protein associations. The CARLSBAD
              database has been developed as an integrated resource, focused on
              high-quality subsets from several bioactivity databases, which
              are aggregated and presented in a uniform manner, suitable for
              the study of the relationships between small molecules and
              targets. In contrast to data collection resources, CARLSBAD
              provides a single normalized activity value of a given type for
              each unique chemical-protein target pair. Two types of scaffold
              perception methods have been implemented and are available for
              datamining: HierS (hierarchical scaffolds) and MCES (maximum
              common edge subgraph). The 2012 release of CARLSBAD contains 439
              985 unique chemical structures, mapped onto 1,420 889 unique
              bioactivities, and annotated with 277 140 HierS scaffolds and 54
              135 MCES chemical patterns, respectively. Of the 890 323 unique
              structure-target pairs curated in CARLSBAD, 13.95\% are
              aggregated from multiple structure-target values: 94 975 are
              aggregated from two bioactivities, 14 544 from three, 7 930 from
              four and 2214 have five bioactivities, respectively. CARLSBAD
              captures bioactivities and tags for 1435 unique chemical
              structures of active pharmaceutical ingredients (i.e. 'drugs').
              CARLSBAD processing resulted in a net 17.3\% data reduction for
              chemicals, 34.3\% reduction for bioactivities, 23\% reduction for
              HierS and 25\% reduction for MCES, respectively. The CARLSBAD

              tackled the problem of linking biological data and drug data
              respectively using RDF. Thus far, the inclusion of chemogenomic
              and systems chemical biology information that crosses the domains
              of chemistry and biology has been very limited RESULTS: We have
              created a single repository called Chem2Bio2RDF by aggregating
              data from multiple chemogenomics repositories that is
              cross-linked into Bio2RDF and LODD. We have also created a

              specific chemical/biological search needs. We demonstrate the

              diseases, side effects and pathways, building a semantic linked
              network consisting of over 290,000 nodes and 720,000 edges. We
              developed a statistical model to assess the association of drug
              target pairs based on their relation with other linked objects.
              Validation experiments demonstrate the model can correctly
              identify known direct drug target pairs with high precision.
              Indirect drug target pairs (for example drugs which change gene
              expression level) are also identified but not as strongly as
              direct pairs. We further calculated the association scores for
              157 drugs from 10 disease areas against 1683 human targets, and
              measured their similarity using a [Formula: see text] score

  abstract = "Uptake through the dopamine transporter (DAT) represents the
              primary mechanism used to terminate dopaminergic transmission in
              brain. Although it is well known that dopamine (DA) taken up by
              the transporter is used to replenish synaptic vesicle stores for
              subsequent release, the molecular details of this mechanism are
              not completely understood. Here, we identified the synaptic
              vesicle protein synaptogyrin-3 as a DAT interacting protein using
              the split ubiquitin system. This interaction was confirmed
              through coimmunoprecipitation experiments using heterologous cell
              lines and mouse brain. DAT and synaptogyrin-3 colocalized at
              presynaptic terminals from mouse striatum. Using fluorescence
              resonance energy transfer microscopy, we show that both proteins
              interact in live neurons. Pull-down assays with GST (glutathione
              S-transferase) proteins revealed that the cytoplasmic N termini
              of both DAT and synaptogyrin-3 are sufficient for this
              interaction. Furthermore, the N terminus of DAT is capable of
              binding purified synaptic vesicles from brain tissue. Functional
              assays revealed that synaptogyrin-3 expression correlated with
              DAT activity in PC12 and MN9D cells, but not in the non-neuronal
              HEK-293 cells. These changes were not attributed to changes in
              transporter cell surface levels or to direct effect of the
              protein-protein interaction. Instead, the synaptogyrin-3 effect
              on DAT activity was abolished in the presence of the vesicular
              monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitor reserpine, suggesting a
              dependence on the vesicular DA storage system. Finally, we
              provide evidence for a biochemical complex involving DAT,
              synaptogyrin-3, and VMAT2. Collectively, our data identify a
              novel interaction between DAT and synaptogyrin-3 and suggest a

               disturbance, sleep dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive
               deficits, dementia, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. A major
               conundrum in this condition is understanding its striking
               clinical variability, which encompasses a spectrum from a benign
               phenotype with levodopa-responsive symptoms and minimal
               progression, to a malignant phenotype with rapid progression to
               severe gait dysfunction, falls and dementia. This book
               integrates the considerable expertise of a range of authors from
               different disciplines, from clinicians through to basic
               scientists, to present a comprehensive and up-to-date overview
               of Parkinson's disease. In recent years, we have made
               significant progress in understanding the pathological and
               genetic basis of Parkinson's disease and its heterogeneous
               forms, and the first section of the book is dedicated to
               reviewing this. The variable clinical features of Parkinson's
               disease and its differential diagnosis are then considered. The
               final section provides a detailed overview of treatment
               approaches, including not only pharmacological therapies but
               also surgical therapies including deep brain stimulation and

               professionals caring for patients with Parkinson's disease, as

              potential by counteracting the degeneration of dopaminergic
              neurons. Transcriptional activation of the sterol regulatory
              element-binding protein (SREBP) is one of the major downstream
              signaling pathways triggered by the cholesterol-lowering effect
              of statins. In a previous study in neuroblastoma cells, we have
              shown that statins consistently induce the upregulation of
              presynaptic dopaminergic proteins and changes of their function
              and these effects were accompanied by downstream activation of
              SREBP. In this study, we aimed to determine the direct role of
              SREBP pathway in the modulation of dopaminergic phenotype. We
              demonstrate that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with U18666A, an
              SREBP activator, increases the translocation of SREBPs into the
              nucleus, increases the expression of SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and of the
              presynaptic dopaminergic markers such as vesicular monoamine
              transporter 2, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A and 2 C,
              synaptogyrin-3, and tyrosine hydroxylase. The addition of SREBP
              inhibitor, PF-429242, blocks the increase of U18666A-induced
              expression of SREBPs and presynaptic markers. Our results, in
              line with previously reported effects of statins, demonstrate
              that direct stimulation of SREBP translocation is associated to
              differentiation toward a dopaminergic-like phenotype and suggest
              that SREBP-mediated transcriptional activity may lead to the
              restoration of the presynaptic dopamine markers and may
              contribute to neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons. These
              findings further support the potential protective role of statin
              in PD and shed light upon SREBP as a potential new target for
              developing disease-modifying treatment in PD.",

  abstract = "The first decade of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) has
              uncovered a wealth of disease-associated variants. Two important
              derivations will be the translation of this information into a
              multiscale understanding of pathogenic variants and leveraging
              existing data to increase the power of existing and future
              studies through prioritization. We explore edge prediction on
              heterogeneous networks--graphs with multiple node and edge
              types--for accomplishing both tasks. First we constructed a
              network with 18 node types--genes, diseases, tissues,
              pathophysiologies, and 14 MSigDB (molecular signatures database)
              collections--and 19 edge types from high-throughput
              publicly-available resources. From this network composed of
              40,343 nodes and 1,608,168 edges, we extracted features that
              describe the topology between specific genes and diseases. Next,
              we trained a model from GWAS associations and predicted the
              probability of association between each protein-coding gene and
              each of 29 well-studied complex diseases. The model, which
              achieved 132-fold enrichment in precision at 10\% recall,
              outperformed any individual domain, highlighting the benefit of
              integrative approaches. We identified pleiotropy, transcriptional
              signatures of perturbations, pathways, and protein interactions
              as influential mechanisms explaining pathogenesis. Our method
              successfully predicted the results (with AUROC = 0.79) from a
              withheld multiple sclerosis (MS) GWAS despite starting with only
              13 previously associated genes. Finally, we combined our network
              predictions with statistical evidence of association to propose
              four novel MS genes, three of which (JAK2, REL, RUNX3) validated
              on the masked GWAS. Furthermore, our predictions provide
              biological support highlighting REL as the causal gene within its
              gene-rich locus. Users can browse all predictions online

              which higher-level reasoning can be conducted. KGs are typically
              stored in a graph-database format, and graph-database queries can
              be used to answer questions of interest that have been posed by
              users such as biomedical researchers. For simple queries, the
              inclusion of direct connections in the KG and the storage and
              analysis of query results are straightforward; however, for
              complex queries, these capabilities become exponentially more
              challenging with each increase in complexity of the query. For
              instance, one relatively complex query can yield a KG with
              hundreds of thousands of query results. Thus, the ability to
              efficiently query, store, rank and explore sub-graphs of a
              complex KG represents a major challenge to any effort designed to
              exploit the use of KGs for applications in biomedical research
              and other domains. We present Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects

              drug-target, gene-disease, etc.) from several existing sources,
              removed duplicate and redundant data, and finally constructed a
              graph database containing 114,550 nodes and 82,674,321
              relationships. When we tested the query execution performance of
              MySQL versus Neo4j, we found that Neo4j outperformed MySQL in all
              cases. While Neo4j exhibited a very fast response for various
              queries, MySQL exhibited latent or unfinished responses for
              complex queries with multiple-join statements. These results show
              that using graph-based databases, such as Neo4j, is an efficient
              way to store complex biological relationships. Moreover, querying

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Implementing clinical phenotypes across a network is
              labor intensive and potentially error prone. Use of a common data
              model may facilitate the process. METHODS: Electronic Medical
              Records and Genomics (eMERGE) sites implemented the Observational
              Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Observational
              Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model across
              their electronic health record (EHR)-linked DNA biobanks. Two
              previously implemented eMERGE phenotypes were converted to OMOP
              and implemented across the network. RESULTS: It was feasible to
              implement the common data model across sites, with laboratory
              data producing the greatest challenge due to local encoding.
              Sites were then able to execute the OMOP phenotype in less than
              one day, as opposed to weeks of effort to manually implement an
              eMERGE phenotype in their bespoke research EHR databases. Of the
              sites that could compare the current OMOP phenotype
              implementation with the original eMERGE phenotype implementation,
              specific agreement ranged from 100\% to 43\%, with disagreements
              due to the original phenotype, the OMOP phenotype, changes in
              data, and issues in the databases. Using the OMOP query as a
              standard comparison revealed differences in the original
              implementations despite starting from the same definitions, code
              lists, flowcharts, and pseudocode. CONCLUSION: Using a common
              data model can dramatically speed phenotype implementation at the
              cost of having to populate that data model, though this will
              produce a net benefit as the number of phenotype implementations
              increases. Inconsistencies among the implementations of the
              original queries point to a potential benefit of using a common
              data model so that actual phenotype code and logic can be shared,
              mitigating human error in reinterpretation of a narrative

              identify a set of small molecules inducing a desired phenotype
              from large small-molecule libraries. However, the resulting set
              of candidate molecules is usually very diverse pharmacologically,
              thus little insight on the shared mechanism of action (MoA)
              underlying their efficacy can be gained. RESULTS: We introduce a
              computational method (Drug-Set Enrichment Analysis-DSEA) based on
              drug-induced gene expression profiles, which is able to identify
              the molecular pathways that are targeted by most of the drugs in
              the set. By diluting drug-specific effects unrelated to the
              phenotype of interest, DSEA is able to highlight
              phenotype-specific pathways, thus helping to formulate hypotheses
              on the MoA shared by the drugs in the set. We validated the
              method by analysing five different drug-sets related to
              well-known pharmacological classes. We then applied DSEA to
              identify the MoA shared by drugs known to be partially effective

              define a set of tightly linked variants likely to contain the

              identify genetic factors robustly associated with lung cancer.
              This review aims to synthesize the literature in this field and
              accelerate the translation of GWAS discoveries into results that
              are closer to clinical applications. A chronologic presentation
              of published GWAS on lung cancer susceptibility, survival, and
              response to treatment is presented. The most important results
              are tabulated to provide a concise overview in one read. GWAS
              have reported 45 lung cancer susceptibility loci with varying
              strength of evidence and highlighted suspected causal genes at
              each locus. Some genetic risk loci have been refined to more
              homogeneous subgroups of lung cancer patients in terms of
              histologic subtypes, smoking status, gender, and ethnicity.
              Overall, these discoveries are an important step for future
              development of new therapeutic targets and biomarkers to
              personalize and improve the quality of care for patients. GWAS
              results are on the edge of offering new tools for targeted
              screening in high-risk individuals, but more research is needed
              if GWAS are to pay off the investment. Complementary genomic
              datasets and functional studies are needed to refine the
              underlying molecular mechanisms of lung cancer preliminarily
              revealed by GWAS and reach results that are medically actionable.

              Consortium (WTCCC) landmark study a decade ago, genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS) have led to the discovery of thousands
              of risk variants involved in disease etiology. This success story
              has two angles that are often overlooked. First, GWAS findings
              are highly replicable. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in
              complex trait genetics, and indeed in many areas of science,
              which in past decades have been plagued by false positives. At a
              time of increasing concerns about the lack of reproducibility, we
              examine the biological and methodological reasons that account
              for the replicability of GWAS and identify the challenges ahead.
              In contrast to the exemplary success of disease gene discovery,
              at present GWAS findings are not useful for predicting
              phenotypes. We close with an overview of the prospects for

              in LD with each other are preferentially in the same block,
              whereas SNPs not in LD are in different blocks. By projecting
              SNPs and genes onto LD blocks, the DistiLD database aims to

              field-normalize the number of citations it has received. Article
              citation rates are divided by an expected citation rate that is

              impact factors to identify influential papers. To illustrate one
              application of our method, we analyzed 88,835 articles published

              underlying traditional 'linear weight' scoring systems (that the
              relative importance, interactions and linearizing transformations
              of the variables are known) can often not be justified on
              theoretical grounds, and empirical 'validation' of weights,
              interactions and transformations, is problematic when a 'gold
              standard' is lacking. With $\mu$-scores (u-scores for
              multivariate data) one can integrate information even if the
              variables have different scales and unknown interactions or if
              the events counted are not directly comparable, as long as the
              variables have an 'orientation'. Using baseball as an example, we
              discuss how measures based on $\mu$-scores can complement the
              existing measures for 'performance' (which may depend on the
              situation) by providing the first multivariate measures for
              'ability' (which should be independent of the situation).
              Recently, $\mu$-scores have been extended to situations where
              count variables are graded by importance or relevance, such as
              medals in the Olympics (Wittkowski 2003) or Tour-de-France

              active athletes), penalties (counting a win more than two ties)
              and hierarchically structured variables (Nordic, alpine, outdoor,
              and indoor Olympic events). The methods presented are not

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: One of the most successful approaches to develop new
              small molecule therapeutics has been to start from a validated
              druggable protein target. However, only a small subset of
              potentially druggable targets has attracted significant research
              and development resources. The Illuminating the Druggable Genome
              (IDG) project develops resources to catalyze the development of
              likely targetable, yet currently understudied prospective drug
              targets. A central component of the IDG program is a
              comprehensive knowledge resource of the druggable genome.
              RESULTS: As part of that effort, we have developed a framework to
              integrate, navigate, and analyze drug discovery data based on
              formalized and standardized classifications and annotations of
              druggable protein targets, the Drug Target Ontology (DTO). DTO
              was constructed by extensive curation and consolidation of
              various resources. DTO classifies the four major drug target
              protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear
              receptors, based on phylogenecity, function, target development
              level, disease association, tissue expression, chemical ligand
              and substrate characteristics, and target-family specific
              characteristics. The formal ontology was built using a new
              software tool to auto-generate most axioms from a database while
              supporting manual knowledge acquisition. A modular, hierarchical
              implementation facilitate ontology development and maintenance
              and makes use of various external ontologies, thus integrating
              the DTO into the ecosystem of biomedical ontologies. As a formal
              OWL-DL ontology, DTO contains asserted and inferred axioms.
              Modeling data from the Library of Integrated Network-based
              Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program illustrates the potential of
              DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced definition of
              important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented
              in the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer
              of protein target disease relationships. CONCLUSIONS: DTO was
              built based on the need for a formal semantic model for druggable
              targets including various related information such as protein,
              gene, protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small
              molecule drug, mechanism of action, protein tissue localization,
              disease association, and many other types of information. DTO
              will further facilitate the otherwise challenging integration and
              formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models,
              drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other
              processes, functions and qualities that are at the core of drug
              discovery. The first version of DTO is publically available via
              the website http://drugtargetontology.org/ , Github (
              http://github.com/DrugTargetOntology/DTO ), and the NCBO
              Bioportal ( http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DTO ).
              The long-term goal of DTO is to provide such an integrative
              framework and to populate the ontology with this information as a
              community resource.",

              disease (CHD). However, the precise way in which one or more
              lipoprotein lipid-related entities account for this relationship

              traits implemented through multivariable Mendelian randomisation
              (MR), we sought to compare their causal roles in the aetiology of
              CHD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a genome-wide association
              study (GWAS) of circulating non-fasted lipoprotein lipid traits
              in the UK Biobank (UKBB) for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
              cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B to identify
              lipid-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using
              data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D for CHD (consisting of 60,801 cases
              and 123,504 controls), we performed univariable and multivariable
              MR analyses. Similar GWAS and MR analyses were conducted for
              high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein
              A-I. The GWAS of lipids and apolipoproteins in the UKBB included
              between 393,193 and 441,016 individuals in whom the mean age was
              56.9 y (range 39-73 y) and of whom 54.2\% were women. The mean
              (standard deviation) lipid concentrations were LDL cholesterol
              3.57 (0.87) mmol/L and HDL cholesterol 1.45 (0.38) mmol/L, and
              the median triglycerides was 1.50 (IQR = 1.11) mmol/L. The mean
              (standard deviation) values for apolipoproteins B and A-I were
              1.03 (0.24) g/L and 1.54 (0.27) g/L, respectively. The GWAS
              identified multiple independent SNPs associated at P < 5 $\times$
              10-8 for LDL cholesterol (220), apolipoprotein B (n = 255),
              triglycerides (440), HDL cholesterol (534), and apolipoprotein
              A-I (440). Between 56\%-93\% of SNPs identified for each lipid
              trait had not been previously reported in large-scale GWASs.
              Almost half (46\%) of these SNPs were associated at P < 5
              $\times$ 10-8 with more than one lipid-related trait. Assessed
              individually using MR, LDL cholesterol (odds ratio [OR] 1.66 per
              1-standard-deviation-higher trait; 95\% CI: 1.49-1.86; P <
              0.001), triglycerides (OR 1.34; 95\% CI: 1.25-1.44; P < 0.001)
              and apolipoprotein B (OR 1.73; 95\% CI: 1.56-1.91; P < 0.001) had
              effect estimates consistent with a higher risk of CHD. In
              multivariable MR, only apolipoprotein B (OR 1.92; 95\% CI:
              1.31-2.81; P < 0.001) retained a robust effect, with the estimate
              for LDL cholesterol (OR 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.57-1.27; P = 0.44)
              reversing and that of triglycerides (OR 1.12; 95\% CI: 1.02-1.23;
              P = 0.01) becoming weaker. Individual MR analyses showed a
              1-standard-deviation-higher HDL cholesterol (OR 0.80; 95\% CI:
              0.75-0.86; P < 0.001) and apolipoprotein A-I (OR 0.83; 95\% CI:
              0.77-0.89; P < 0.001) to lower the risk of CHD, but these effect
              estimates attenuated substantially to the null on accounting for
              apolipoprotein B. A limitation is that, owing to the nature of
              lipoprotein metabolism, measures related to the composition of
              lipoprotein particles are highly correlated, creating a challenge
              in making exclusive interpretations on causation of individual
              components. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that
              apolipoprotein B is the predominant trait that accounts for the
              aetiological relationship of lipoprotein lipids with risk of CHD.",

              obesity and diabetes. The mechanisms of this paradox remain

              thermogenesis and promotes systemic BCAA clearance in mice and

              attenuates systemic BCAA clearance, BAT fuel oxidation and
              thermogenesis, leading to diet-induced obesity and glucose
              intolerance. Mechanistically, active BCAA catabolism in BAT is
              mediated by SLC25A44, which transports BCAAs into mitochondria.
              Our results suggest that BAT serves as a key metabolic filter
              that controls BCAA clearance via SLC25A44, thereby contributing

              with elevated plasma concentration of branched-chain amino acids
              (BCAAs) and impaired BCAA metabolism. However, it is unknown
              whether the insulin-sensitising effect of long-term exercise can
              be explained by concomitant change in BCAAs and their metabolism.
              METHODS: We included 26 sedentary overweight and normal-weight
              middle-aged men from the MyoGlu clinical trial, with or without
              dysglycaemia, for 12 weeks of supervised intensive exercise
              intervention, including two endurance and two resistance sessions
              weekly. Insulin sensitivity was measured as the glucose infusion
              rate (GIR) from a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. In
              addition, maximum oxygen uptake, upper and lower body strength
              and adipose tissue depots (using MRI and spectroscopy) were
              measured, and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (ScWAT) and
              skeletal muscle (SkM) biopsies were harvested both before and
              after the 12 week intervention. In the present study we have
              measured plasma BCAAs and related metabolites using CG-MS/MS and
              HPLC-MS/MS, and performed global mRNA-sequencing pathway analysis
              on ScWAT and SkM. RESULTS: In MyoGlu, men with dysglycaemia
              displayed lower GIR, more fat mass and higher liver fat content
              than normoglycaemic men at baseline, and 12 weeks of exercise
              increased GIR, improved body composition and reduced liver fat
              content similarly for both groups. In our current study we
              observed higher plasma concentrations of BCAAs (14.4\%, p = 0.01)
              and related metabolites, such as 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (19.4\%, p
              = 0.034) in dysglycaemic vs normoglycaemic men at baseline.
              Baseline plasma BCAA levels correlated negatively to the change
              in GIR ($\rho$ = -0.41, p = 0.037) and [Formula: see text]
              ($\rho$ = -0.47, p = 0.015) after 12 weeks of exercise and
              positively to amounts of intraperitoneal fat ($\rho$ = 0.40, p =
              0.044) and liver fat ($\rho$ = 0.58, p = 0.01). However,
              circulating BCAAs and related metabolites did not respond to 12
              weeks of exercise, with the exception of isoleucine, which
              increased in normoglycaemic men (10 $\mu$mol/l, p = 0.01).
              Pathway analyses of mRNA-sequencing data implied reduced BCAA
              catabolism in both SkM and ScWAT in men with dysglycaemia
              compared with men with normoglycaemia at baseline. Gene
              expression levels related to BCAA metabolism correlated
              positively with GIR and markers of mitochondrial content in both
              SkM and ScWAT, and negatively with fat mass generally, and
              particularly with intraperitoneal fat mass. mRNA-sequencing
              pathway analysis also implied increased BCAA metabolism after 12
              weeks of exercise in both groups and in both tissues, including
              enhanced expression of the gene encoding branched-chain
              $\alpha$-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) and reduced expression of
              the BCKDH phosphatase in both groups and tissues. Gene expression
              of SLC25A44, which encodes a mitochondrial BCAA transporter, was
              increased in SkM in both groups, and gene expression of BCKDK,
              which encodes BCKDH kinase, was reduced in ScWAT in dysglycaemic
              men. Mediation analyses indicated a pronounced effect of enhanced
              SkM (~53\%, p = 0.022), and a moderate effect of enhanced ScWAT
              (~18\%, p = 0.018) BCAA metabolism on improved insulin
              sensitivity after 12 weeks of exercise, based on mRNA sequencing.
              In comparison, plasma concentration of BCAAs did not mediate any
              effect in this regard. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Plasma BCAA
              concentration was largely unresponsive to long-term exercise and
              unrelated to exercise-induced insulin sensitivity. On the other
              hand, the insulin-sensitising effect of long-term exercise in men
              may be explained by enhanced SkM and, to a lesser degree, also by
              enhanced ScWAT BCAA catabolism. Graphical abstract.",

              in solution that inhibit many enzymes. In contrast, drugs are
              thought to act specifically. To investigate this assumption, 50
              unrelated drugs were tested for promiscuous inhibition via
              aggregation. Each drug was tested against three unrelated model
              enzymes: beta-lactamase, chymotrypsin, and malate dehydrogenase,
              none of which are considered targets of these drugs. To be judged
              promiscuous, the drugs had to inhibit all three enzymes, do so in
              a time-dependent manner, be sensitive to detergent and to enzyme
              concentration, and form particles detectable by light scattering.
              Of the 50 drugs tested, 43 were nonpromiscuous by these criteria.
              Surprisingly, four of the drugs showed promiscuous,
              aggregation-based inhibition at concentrations below 100 microM:
              clotrimazole, benzyl benzoate, nicardipine, and delavirdine.
              Three other drugs also behaved as aggregation-based inhibitors,
              but only at high concentrations (about 400 microM). To
              investigate possible structure-activity relationships among
              promiscuous drugs, five analogues of the antifungal clotrimazole
              were studied. Three of these, miconazole, econazole, and
              sulconazole, were promiscuous but the other two, fluconazole and
              ketoconazole, were not. Using recursive partitioning, these
              experimental results were used to develop a model for predicting
              aggregate-based promiscuity. This model correctly classified 94\%
              of 111 compounds-47 aggregators and 64 nonaggregators-that have
              been studied for this effect. To evaluate the model, it was used
              to predict the behavior of 75 drugs not previously investigated
              for aggregation. Several preliminary points emerge. Most drugs
              are not promiscuous, even at high concentrations. Nevertheless,
              at high enough concentrations (20-400 microM), some drugs can
              aggregate and act promiscuously, suggesting that aggregation may
              be common among small molecules at micromolar concentrations, at

              nondrug-like molecules. This task is performed by using two
              different set of 1D and 2D parameters. The 1D parameters contain
              information about the entire molecule like the molecular weight
              and the the 2D parameters contain information about specific
              functional groups within the molecule. Our best results predict
              correctly on over 90\% of the compounds in the CMC while
              classifying about 10\% of the molecules in the ACD as drug-like.
              Excellent generalization ability is shown by the models in that
              roughly 80\% of the molecules in the MDDR are classified as
              drug-like. We propose to use the models to design combinatorial
              libraries. In a computer experiment on generating a drug-like
              library of size 100 from a set of 10 000 molecules we obtain at
              least a 3 or 4 order of magnitude improvement over random
              methods. The neighborhoods defined by our models are not similar
              to the ones generated by standard Tanimoto similarity
              calculations. Therefore, new and different information is being
              generated by our models, and so it can supplement standard
              diversity approaches to library design.",

              typically results in numerous small molecule hits that must be

              several filtering mechanisms and other tools exist that can
              assist the chemist in this process, it is often the case that
              costly synthetic resources are expended in pursuing false
              positives. We report here a rapid and reliable NMR-based method
              for identifying reactive false positives including those that
              oxidize or alkylate a protein target. Importantly, the reactive
              species need not be the parent compound, as both reactive
              impurities and breakdown products can be detected. The assay is
              called ALARM NMR (a La assay to detect reactive molecules by
              nuclear magnetic resonance) and is based on monitoring
              DTT-dependent (13)C chemical shift changes of the human La
              antigen in the presence of a test compound or mixture. Extensive
              validation has been performed to demonstrate the reliability and

              compounds containing HTS hits from 23 drug targets. The data show
              that current in silico filtering tools fail to identify more than
              half of the compounds that can act via reactive mechanisms.
              Significantly, we show how ALARM NMR data has been critical in
              identifying reactive compounds that would otherwise have been
              prioritized for lead optimization. In addition, a new filtering
              tool has been developed on the basis of the ALARM NMR data that

              the drug discovery process. For this purpose, a descriptor is

              and drug development projects are being generated in the
              pharmaceutical industry and more recently in the public sector.
              The resulting experimental datasets are increasingly being
              disseminated via publically accessible repositories. However,
              existing repositories lack sufficient metadata to describe the
              experiments and are often difficult to navigate by non-experts.
              The lack of standardized descriptions and semantics of biological
              assays and screening results hinder targeted data retrieval,
              integration, aggregation, and analyses across different HTS
              datasets, for example to infer mechanisms of action of small
              molecule perturbagens. To address these limitations, we created
              the BioAssay Ontology (BAO). BAO has been developed with a focus
              on data integration and analysis enabling the classification of
              assays and screening results by concepts that relate to format,
              assay design, technology, target, and endpoint. Previously, we
              reported on the higher-level design of BAO and on the semantic
              querying capabilities offered by the ontology-indexed triple
              store of HTS data. Here, we report on our detailed design,
              annotation pipeline, substantially enlarged annotation
              knowledgebase, and analysis results. We used BAO to annotate
              assays from the largest public HTS data repository, PubChem, and
              demonstrate its utility to categorize and analyze diverse HTS
              results from numerous experiments. BAO is publically available
              from the NCBO BioPortal at
              http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1533. BAO provides
              controlled terminology and uniform scope to report probe and drug
              discovery screening assays and results. BAO leverages description
              logic to formalize the domain knowledge and facilitate the
              semantic integration with diverse other resources. As a
              consequence, BAO offers the potential to infer new knowledge from
              a corpus of assay results, for example molecular mechanisms of
              action of perturbagens.",

              algorithm rapidly identifies all possible ring-delimited
              substructures within a set of compounds. Molecules are grouped by
              shared ring substructures (scaffolds) so that common scaffolds
              obtain higher membership. Once all of the scaffolds for a set of
              compounds are identified, the hierarchical structural
              relationships between the scaffold structures are established.
              The complex network of hierarchical relationships is then
              utilized to navigate compounds in a structurally directed
              fashion. When the scaffold hierarchy is traversed,
              over-represented structural features can be rapidly identified so
              that excess compounds that contain them can be removed without
              significantly impacting the structural diversity landscape of the

              screening, in which we observed a surprisingly large number of
              compounds that can oxidize or form covalent adducts with protein
              thiols groups. In the vast majority of these cases, the covalent
              interactions are largely nonspecific (e.g., affect many protein
              targets) and therefore unsuitable for drug development. However,
              certain thiol-reactive species do appear to inhibit the target of
              interest in a specific manner. The question then arises as to the
              potential toxicology risks of developing a drug that can react

              activity of the cluster members. However, when molecules are
              clustered using fingerprints, it may be difficult to decipher the

              Previously, we have used reduced graphs, where each node
              corresponds to a generalized functional group, as topological
              molecular descriptors for virtual screening. In this work, we
              precluster a database using any clustering method. We then
              represent the molecules in a cluster as reduced graphs. By
              repeated application of a maximum common edge substructure (MCES)
              algorithm, we obtain one or more reduced graph cluster
              representatives. The sparsity of the reduced graphs means that
              the MCES calculations can be performed in real time. The reduced
              graph cluster representatives are readily interpretable in terms
              of functional activity and can be mapped directly back to the

              fingerprint version of the hierarchical k-means algorithm.
              Chemotypes are extracted from the terminal clusters via a maximum
              common substructure approach. Molecules forming a chemotype have
              to share a predefined number of rings, atoms, and non-carbon
              heavy atoms. In an iterative procedure, similar chemotypes and
              singletons are fused to larger chemotypes. Singletons that cannot
              be assigned to any chemotype are then grouped based on the
              proportion of overlap between the molecules. Representatives from
              each chemotype and the singletons are used in a second round of

              obtain an algorithm that is guaranteed to find the optimum

              speeding up computations on these families. We also extend the

              human small-molecule drugs, chemogenomics datasets and screening
              compounds including a natural products set. We estimate the
              acid-ionization constant (pK(a)) values of these compounds and
              determine the identity of the ionizable functional groups in each
              set. We find substantial differences in acid/base profiles of the

              linked to the nature of the target binding site and the
              corresponding functional groups needed for recognition of the
