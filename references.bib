  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recently there has been an explosion of new data
              sources about genes, proteins, genetic variations, chemical
              compounds, diseases and drugs. Integration of these data sources
              and the identification of patterns that go across them is of
              critical interest. Initiatives such as Bio2RDF and LODD have
              tackled the problem of linking biological data and drug data
              respectively using RDF. Thus far, the inclusion of chemogenomic
              and systems chemical biology information that crosses the domains
              of chemistry and biology has been very limited RESULTS: We have
              created a single repository called Chem2Bio2RDF by aggregating
              data from multiple chemogenomics repositories that is
              cross-linked into Bio2RDF and LODD. We have also created a
              linked-path generation tool to facilitate SPARQL query
              generation, and have created extended SPARQL functions to address
              specific chemical/biological search needs. We demonstrate the
              utility of Chem2Bio2RDF in investigating polypharmacology,
              identification of potential multiple pathway inhibitors, and the
              association of pathways with adverse drug reactions. CONCLUSIONS:
              We have created a new semantic systems chemical biology resource,
              and have demonstrated its potential usefulness in specific
              examples of polypharmacology, multiple pathway inhibition and
              adverse drug reaction--pathway mapping. We have also demonstrated
              the usefulness of extending SPARQL with cheminformatics and
              bioinformatics functionality.",

  author   = "Chen, Bin and Ding, Ying and Wild, David J",
  abstract = "The rapidly increasing amount of public data in chemistry and
              biology provides new opportunities for large-scale data mining
              for drug discovery. Systematic integration of these heterogeneous
              sets and provision of algorithms to data mine the integrated sets
              would permit investigation of complex mechanisms of action of
              drugs. In this work we integrated and annotated data from public
              datasets relating to drugs, chemical compounds, protein targets,
              diseases, side effects and pathways, building a semantic linked
              network consisting of over 290,000 nodes and 720,000 edges. We
              developed a statistical model to assess the association of drug
              target pairs based on their relation with other linked objects.
              Validation experiments demonstrate the model can correctly
              identify known direct drug target pairs with high precision.
              Indirect drug target pairs (for example drugs which change gene
              expression level) are also identified but not as strongly as
              direct pairs. We further calculated the association scores for
              157 drugs from 10 disease areas against 1683 human targets, and
              measured their similarity using a [Formula: see text] score
              matrix. The similarity network indicates that drugs from the same
              disease area tend to cluster together in ways that are not
              captured by structural similarity, with several potential new
              drug pairings being identified. This work thus provides a novel,
              validated alternative to existing drug target prediction
              algorithms. The web service is freely available at:
