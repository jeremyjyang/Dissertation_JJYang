  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recently there has been an explosion of new data
              sources about genes, proteins, genetic variations, chemical
              compounds, diseases and drugs. Integration of these data sources
              and the identification of patterns that go across them is of
              critical interest. Initiatives such as Bio2RDF and LODD have
              tackled the problem of linking biological data and drug data
              respectively using RDF. Thus far, the inclusion of chemogenomic
              and systems chemical biology information that crosses the domains
              of chemistry and biology has been very limited RESULTS: We have
              created a single repository called Chem2Bio2RDF by aggregating
              data from multiple chemogenomics repositories that is
              cross-linked into Bio2RDF and LODD. We have also created a
              linked-path generation tool to facilitate SPARQL query
              generation, and have created extended SPARQL functions to address
              specific chemical/biological search needs. We demonstrate the
              utility of Chem2Bio2RDF in investigating polypharmacology,
              identification of potential multiple pathway inhibitors, and the
              association of pathways with adverse drug reactions. CONCLUSIONS:
              We have created a new semantic systems chemical biology resource,
              and have demonstrated its potential usefulness in specific
              examples of polypharmacology, multiple pathway inhibition and
              adverse drug reaction--pathway mapping. We have also demonstrated
              the usefulness of extending SPARQL with cheminformatics and
              bioinformatics functionality.",

  title    = "Assessing drug target association using semantic linked data",
  author   = "Chen, Bin and Ding, Ying and Wild, David J",
  abstract = "The rapidly increasing amount of public data in chemistry and
              biology provides new opportunities for large-scale data mining
              for drug discovery. Systematic integration of these heterogeneous
              sets and provision of algorithms to data mine the integrated sets
              would permit investigation of complex mechanisms of action of
              drugs. In this work we integrated and annotated data from public
              datasets relating to drugs, chemical compounds, protein targets,
              diseases, side effects and pathways, building a semantic linked
              network consisting of over 290,000 nodes and 720,000 edges. We
              developed a statistical model to assess the association of drug
              target pairs based on their relation with other linked objects.
              Validation experiments demonstrate the model can correctly
              identify known direct drug target pairs with high precision.
              Indirect drug target pairs (for example drugs which change gene
              expression level) are also identified but not as strongly as
              direct pairs. We further calculated the association scores for
              157 drugs from 10 disease areas against 1683 human targets, and
              measured their similarity using a [Formula: see text] score
              matrix. The similarity network indicates that drugs from the same
              disease area tend to cluster together in ways that are not
              captured by structural similarity, with several potential new
              drug pairings being identified. This work thus provides a novel,
              validated alternative to existing drug target prediction
              algorithms. The web service is freely available at:

              tissue micro-environments, antibodies, and disease-causing

              only a subset of targets within them have attracted significant
              research attention and thus have information about them publicly
              available. The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program
              was initiated in 2014, has the goal of developing experimental
              techniques and a Knowledge Management Center (KMC) that would
              collect and organize information about protein targets from four

              primary mechanism used to terminate dopaminergic transmission in
              brain. Although it is well known that dopamine (DA) taken up by
              the transporter is used to replenish synaptic vesicle stores for
              subsequent release, the molecular details of this mechanism are
              not completely understood. Here, we identified the synaptic
              vesicle protein synaptogyrin-3 as a DAT interacting protein using
              the split ubiquitin system. This interaction was confirmed
              through coimmunoprecipitation experiments using heterologous cell
              lines and mouse brain. DAT and synaptogyrin-3 colocalized at
              presynaptic terminals from mouse striatum. Using fluorescence
              resonance energy transfer microscopy, we show that both proteins
              interact in live neurons. Pull-down assays with GST (glutathione
              S-transferase) proteins revealed that the cytoplasmic N termini
              of both DAT and synaptogyrin-3 are sufficient for this
              interaction. Furthermore, the N terminus of DAT is capable of
              binding purified synaptic vesicles from brain tissue. Functional
              assays revealed that synaptogyrin-3 expression correlated with
              DAT activity in PC12 and MN9D cells, but not in the non-neuronal
              HEK-293 cells. These changes were not attributed to changes in
              transporter cell surface levels or to direct effect of the
              protein-protein interaction. Instead, the synaptogyrin-3 effect
              on DAT activity was abolished in the presence of the vesicular
              monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitor reserpine, suggesting a
              dependence on the vesicular DA storage system. Finally, we
              provide evidence for a biochemical complex involving DAT,
              synaptogyrin-3, and VMAT2. Collectively, our data identify a
              novel interaction between DAT and synaptogyrin-3 and suggest a
              physical and functional link between DAT and the vesicular DA
              system.",

               also a broad range of nonmotor features, including mood
               disturbance, sleep dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive
               deficits, dementia, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. A major
               conundrum in this condition is understanding its striking
               clinical variability, which encompasses a spectrum from a benign
               phenotype with levodopa-responsive symptoms and minimal
               progression, to a malignant phenotype with rapid progression to
               severe gait dysfunction, falls and dementia. This book
               integrates the considerable expertise of a range of authors from
               different disciplines, from clinicians through to basic
               scientists, to present a comprehensive and up-to-date overview
               of Parkinson's disease. In recent years, we have made
               significant progress in understanding the pathological and
               genetic basis of Parkinson's disease and its heterogeneous
               forms, and the first section of the book is dedicated to
               reviewing this. The variable clinical features of Parkinson's
               disease and its differential diagnosis are then considered. The
               final section provides a detailed overview of treatment
               approaches, including not only pharmacological therapies but
               also surgical therapies including deep brain stimulation and
               cell transplantation strategies. The combination of basic
               biology, clinical knowledge and therapeutics gives this book a
               very broad appeal. It will be of value to clinicians and health
               professionals caring for patients with Parkinson's disease, as

              risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) and may hold neuroprotective
              potential by counteracting the degeneration of dopaminergic
              neurons. Transcriptional activation of the sterol regulatory
              element-binding protein (SREBP) is one of the major downstream
              signaling pathways triggered by the cholesterol-lowering effect
              of statins. In a previous study in neuroblastoma cells, we have
              shown that statins consistently induce the upregulation of
              presynaptic dopaminergic proteins and changes of their function
              and these effects were accompanied by downstream activation of
              SREBP. In this study, we aimed to determine the direct role of
              SREBP pathway in the modulation of dopaminergic phenotype. We
              demonstrate that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with U18666A, an
              SREBP activator, increases the translocation of SREBPs into the
              nucleus, increases the expression of SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and of the
              presynaptic dopaminergic markers such as vesicular monoamine
              transporter 2, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A and 2 C,
              synaptogyrin-3, and tyrosine hydroxylase. The addition of SREBP
              inhibitor, PF-429242, blocks the increase of U18666A-induced
              expression of SREBPs and presynaptic markers. Our results, in
              line with previously reported effects of statins, demonstrate
              that direct stimulation of SREBP translocation is associated to
              differentiation toward a dopaminergic-like phenotype and suggest
              that SREBP-mediated transcriptional activity may lead to the
              restoration of the presynaptic dopamine markers and may
              contribute to neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons. These
              findings further support the potential protective role of statin
              in PD and shed light upon SREBP as a potential new target for
              developing disease-modifying treatment in PD.",

              uncovered a wealth of disease-associated variants. Two important
              derivations will be the translation of this information into a
              multiscale understanding of pathogenic variants and leveraging
              existing data to increase the power of existing and future
              studies through prioritization. We explore edge prediction on
              heterogeneous networks--graphs with multiple node and edge
              types--for accomplishing both tasks. First we constructed a
              network with 18 node types--genes, diseases, tissues,
              pathophysiologies, and 14 MSigDB (molecular signatures database)
              collections--and 19 edge types from high-throughput
              publicly-available resources. From this network composed of
              40,343 nodes and 1,608,168 edges, we extracted features that
              describe the topology between specific genes and diseases. Next,
              we trained a model from GWAS associations and predicted the
              probability of association between each protein-coding gene and
              each of 29 well-studied complex diseases. The model, which
              achieved 132-fold enrichment in precision at 10\% recall,
              outperformed any individual domain, highlighting the benefit of
              integrative approaches. We identified pleiotropy, transcriptional
              signatures of perturbations, pathways, and protein interactions
              as influential mechanisms explaining pathogenesis. Our method
              successfully predicted the results (with AUROC = 0.79) from a
              withheld multiple sclerosis (MS) GWAS despite starting with only
              13 previously associated genes. Finally, we combined our network
              predictions with statistical evidence of association to propose
              four novel MS genes, three of which (JAK2, REL, RUNX3) validated
              on the masked GWAS. Furthermore, our predictions provide

              which higher-level reasoning can be conducted. KGs are typically

              be used to answer questions of interest that have been posed by
              users such as biomedical researchers. For simple queries, the
              inclusion of direct connections in the KG and the storage and
              analysis of query results are straightforward; however, for
              complex queries, these capabilities become exponentially more
              challenging with each increase in complexity of the query. For
              instance, one relatively complex query can yield a KG with
              hundreds of thousands of query results. Thus, the ability to
              efficiently query, store, rank and explore sub-graphs of a
              complex KG represents a major challenge to any effort designed to
              exploit the use of KGs for applications in biomedical research

              tissues and individual cell lineages is crucial for developing
              improved diagnostics and therapeutics. We present genome-wide
              functional interaction networks for 144 human tissues and cell
              types developed using a data-driven Bayesian methodology that
              integrates thousands of diverse experiments spanning tissue and

              responses to perturbation, identify the changing functional roles
              of genes across tissues and illuminate relationships among
              diseases. We introduce NetWAS, which combines genes with
              nominally significant genome-wide association study (GWAS) P

              provide a powerful framework for storage, querying and
              envisioning of biological data. RESULTS: We show how graph

              biological activity of small molecules on protein targets.
              Information in these databases is often hard to resolve with
              certainty because of subsetting different data in a variety of
              formats; use of different bioactivity metrics; use of different
              identifiers for chemicals and proteins; and having to access
              different query interfaces, respectively. Given the multitude of
              data sources, interfaces and standards, it is challenging to
              gather relevant facts and make appropriate connections and
              decisions regarding chemical-protein associations. The CARLSBAD
              database has been developed as an integrated resource, focused on
              high-quality subsets from several bioactivity databases, which
              are aggregated and presented in a uniform manner, suitable for
              the study of the relationships between small molecules and
              targets. In contrast to data collection resources, CARLSBAD
              provides a single normalized activity value of a given type for
              each unique chemical-protein target pair. Two types of scaffold
              perception methods have been implemented and are available for
              datamining: HierS (hierarchical scaffolds) and MCES (maximum
              common edge subgraph). The 2012 release of CARLSBAD contains 439
              985 unique chemical structures, mapped onto 1,420 889 unique
              bioactivities, and annotated with 277 140 HierS scaffolds and 54
              135 MCES chemical patterns, respectively. Of the 890 323 unique
              structure-target pairs curated in CARLSBAD, 13.95\% are
              aggregated from multiple structure-target values: 94 975 are
              aggregated from two bioactivities, 14 544 from three, 7 930 from
              four and 2214 have five bioactivities, respectively. CARLSBAD
              captures bioactivities and tags for 1435 unique chemical
              structures of active pharmaceutical ingredients (i.e. 'drugs').
              CARLSBAD processing resulted in a net 17.3\% data reduction for
              chemicals, 34.3\% reduction for bioactivities, 23\% reduction for

  abstract = "Understanding complex relationships among heterogeneous
              biological data is one of the fundamental goals in biology. In
              most cases, diverse biological data are stored in relational
              databases, such as MySQL and Oracle, which store data in multiple
              tables and then infer relationships by multiple-join statements.
              Recently, a new type of database, called the graph-based
              database, was developed to natively represent various kinds of
              complex relationships, and it is widely used among computer
              science communities and IT industries. Here, we demonstrate the
              feasibility of using a graph-based database for complex
              biological relationships by comparing the performance between
              MySQL and Neo4j, one of the most widely used graph databases. We
              collected various biological data (protein-protein interaction,
              drug-target, gene-disease, etc.) from several existing sources,
              removed duplicate and redundant data, and finally constructed a
              graph database containing 114,550 nodes and 82,674,321
              relationships. When we tested the query execution performance of
              MySQL versus Neo4j, we found that Neo4j outperformed MySQL in all
              cases. While Neo4j exhibited a very fast response for various
              queries, MySQL exhibited latent or unfinished responses for
              complex queries with multiple-join statements. These results show
              that using graph-based databases, such as Neo4j, is an efficient
              way to store complex biological relationships. Moreover, querying
              a graph database in diverse ways has the potential to reveal

              model may facilitate the process. METHODS: Electronic Medical
              Records and Genomics (eMERGE) sites implemented the Observational
              Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Observational
              Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model across
              their electronic health record (EHR)-linked DNA biobanks. Two
              previously implemented eMERGE phenotypes were converted to OMOP
              and implemented across the network. RESULTS: It was feasible to
              implement the common data model across sites, with laboratory
              data producing the greatest challenge due to local encoding.
              Sites were then able to execute the OMOP phenotype in less than
              one day, as opposed to weeks of effort to manually implement an
              eMERGE phenotype in their bespoke research EHR databases. Of the
              sites that could compare the current OMOP phenotype
              implementation with the original eMERGE phenotype implementation,
              specific agreement ranged from 100\% to 43\%, with disagreements
              due to the original phenotype, the OMOP phenotype, changes in
              data, and issues in the databases. Using the OMOP query as a
              standard comparison revealed differences in the original
              implementations despite starting from the same definitions, code
              lists, flowcharts, and pseudocode. CONCLUSION: Using a common
              data model can dramatically speed phenotype implementation at the
              cost of having to populate that data model, though this will
              produce a net benefit as the number of phenotype implementations
              increases. Inconsistencies among the implementations of the
              original queries point to a potential benefit of using a common
              data model so that actual phenotype code and logic can be shared,

              computational method (Drug-Set Enrichment Analysis-DSEA) based on
              drug-induced gene expression profiles, which is able to identify
              the molecular pathways that are targeted by most of the drugs in
              the set. By diluting drug-specific effects unrelated to the
              phenotype of interest, DSEA is able to highlight
              phenotype-specific pathways, thus helping to formulate hypotheses
              on the MoA shared by the drugs in the set. We validated the
              method by analysing five different drug-sets related to
              well-known pharmacological classes. We then applied DSEA to
              identify the MoA shared by drugs known to be partially effective
              in rescuing mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
              regulator (CFTR) gene function in Cystic Fibrosis. AVAILABILITY
              AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is implemented as an online web
              tool publicly available at http://dsea.tigem.it. CONTACT:
